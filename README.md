# Room Booking App
A project i made as part of my elective course 'Mobile Development' at university. The application allows a user (via android device) to book rooms and equipment available at the university. User accounts/authentication is handled by a 'Fire Base' system, and all HTTP requests are done by accessing the university's REST service.
